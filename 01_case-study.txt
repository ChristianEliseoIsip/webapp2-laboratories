After evaluating the situation, it is notable that the problem lies within a team's project management procedures and processes.

The problem is highly timely, relating to our recent assignment on our subject, "System Analysis, Design, and Development." The assignment includes project management tools such as Gantt charts, COCOMO, and project network diagrams. These tools aid project teams in facilitating planning, scheduling, resource allocation, cost estimation, and monitoring their project status throughout the project. However, it is crucial to allot ample time to learn how to use these tools to maximize their effectiveness.

The project management tools are just instruments that will boost a team's productivity. They are heavily dependent on the collaboration and cohesion of the team. Even the most sophisticated tools will prove useless if the members do not actively make efforts to communicate and share the same goal. If communication does not exist within a team, the progress will be difficult to track, leading to other issues, including incomplete tasks and unresolved errors. The testing process occurs at the end of the project's duration; if the project components execution gets delayed, the testing will be delayed, thus delaying the overall project completion. Without team synergy, any project will crumble.
